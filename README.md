======

### How to Download?
Go to [CSDJ Releases](https://github.com/sarthak247/CSDJ/releases/latest) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Or clone this repository and run the Python script.

### How to use?
Just extract, run CSDJ.exe or ./csdj, and profit!
Enter the song name, it supports caching so you dont redownload it everytime.
For first use, you need to enter your CSGO install path.
It is usually the following-
 ```
 C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive
 ```
 or
 ```
 /home/$USER/.steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive
 ```
 
 ### In Game
 Hit your console key. In console, type
 ```
 exec csdj
 ```
 to load CSDJ into CSGO.
 Next, while in-game, you can use '/' key to play music continuously or use ' key to push-to-play.
 ### Note-
 If the song ends, you need to press the '/' key again to use your microphone.
 
 ### Can I get a VAC Ban by using this?
 No. This does not run with CSGO nor does it interact with it, so you cannot get a VAC ban!
 
 ### My Anti Virus says your app might be a virus!
 It is a false positive. We are using system calls to copy files to your C: drive, thus some antivirus may detect it. We haven't obfuscated the code so that you can decompile the code to check out what happens under the hood!
